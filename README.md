# Implementation and Research of meta-learning algorithms with python

We partition meta learning problems into three parts: model-based, metric-based and optimization-based. 

## A curated set of papers which I will implement with python

### Optimization-based

* __Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks__ (2017). [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.03400.pdf)

* __Fast Context Adaptation via Meta-Learning__ (2018). [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03642.pdf)

* __Rapid Learning or Feature Reuse? Towards Understanding the Effectiveness of MAML__ (2019). [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.09157.pdf)
